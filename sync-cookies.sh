# ~/Desktop is a macOS TCC-protected folder, so the launchd-spawned bash has no
# permission to read/execute files under it (fails with exit 126 "Operation not
# permitted"). The agent therefore runs an installed COPY from a non-protected
# location. After editing this file, re-copy it (see COOKIE-SYNC-SETUP.md).
